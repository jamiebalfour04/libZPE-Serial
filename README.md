The official ZPE serial port communications library. This library is relatively new and requires some work to keep it up to date. It uses the com.fazecast.jSerialComm library.

This library was one of the first I started to develop for ZPE, but it fell into a state of disrepair.

Due to significant improvements in the ZPE Plugin Engine (ZPE) this plugin actually works again and it is maintained again.
